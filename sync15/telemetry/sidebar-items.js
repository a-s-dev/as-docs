May have many syncs, may have many events. However, due to the architecture of apps which use these components, this payload is almost certainly not suitable for submitting directly. For example, we will always return a payload with exactly 1 sync, and it will not know certain other fields in the payload, such as the hashed FxA device ID (see https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c3ebaf6de2d481c262c04bb9657eaf76bf47e2ac/services/sync/modules/browserid_identity.js#185 for an example of how the device ID is constructed). The intention is that consumers of this will use this to create a \"real\" payload - eg, accumulating until some threshold number of syncs is reached, and contributing additional data which only the consumer knows."],["Validation",""]]});
