Note that history specifically needs neither (a) login's \"changed\" (the changeCounter works there), nor (b) bookmark's \"unknown\" (as that's only used after a restore). History only needs a distinction between \"synced\" and \"new\" so it doesn't accumulate never-to-be-synced tombstones - so we basically copy bookmarks and treat unknown as new. Which means we get the \"bonus side-effect\" ;) of ::Unknown replacing Option<>!"],["VisitTransition",""]],"mod":[["visit_transition_set",""]],"struct":[["InvalidVisitType",""],["Timestamp",""],["VisitTransitionSerdeVisitor",""],["VisitTransitionSet",""]]});
